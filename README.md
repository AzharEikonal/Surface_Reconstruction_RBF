# Surface Reconstruction from Point Cloud Data using Libigl

We reconstruct smooth surfaces from the point cloud data using the RBF interpolation. We  also optimize the code for the large data sets using the center reduction technique where we can reconstruct reasonable good surfaces from large data sets just by taking a subset from the initial data set. 

## See the tutorial first

Then build, run and understand the [libigl
tutorial](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/).

## Dependencies

The only dependencies are STL, Eigen, [libigl](http://libigl.github.io/libigl/) and the dependencies
of the `igl::opengl::glfw::Viewer` (OpenGL, glad and GLFW).
The CMake build system will automatically download libigl and its dependencies using
[CMake FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html),
thus requiring no setup on your part.

To use a local copy of libigl rather than downloading the repository via FetchContent, you can use
the CMake cache variable `FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_LIBIGL` when configuring your CMake project for
the first time:
```
cmake -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_LIBIGL=<path-to-libigl> ..
```
When changing this value, do not forget to clear your `CMakeCache.txt`, or to update the cache variable
via `cmake-gui` or `ccmake`.

## Compile

Compile this project using the standard cmake routine:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This should find and build the dependencies and create a `example_bin` binary.

## Run

From within the `build` directory just issue:

    ./example

A glfw app should launch displaying a 3D cube.
